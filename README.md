## Overview
This project was mainly for practising with Javascript. Therefore the CSS is good for given screensizes but not for all screensizes. Time spend to finish the project about 9 hours.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size, build for mobile 360px and desktop 1440px.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
